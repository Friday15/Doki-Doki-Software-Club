RIA;We are on your last stop, (Player). We are in the Law Library in BGC and i want you to meet LERA, she's the Legal Education Reference Assistant.;0;L
LERA;Hi (Player). I believe this is your last task which is about treating and applying information ethically.;0;R
Player;Is there such a thing as treating and applying information ethically?:line,4
LERA;Are you familiar with plagiarism, copyright, fair use, and public domain?;0;R
Player;Not so much. Can you expound on them?:line,6
LERA;First, you have to avoid committing plagiarism, and I know that you already know how to do that.;0;R
Player;Yes, cite your sources correctly.:line,8
LERA;Good. But do you know that we have a software, which can help us prevent plagiarism?;0;R
Player;Yes, I've heard Turnitin. It matches your paper to online databases and other student submitted papers.:line,10
LERA;That's right. Now, there's copyright. It's copying, performing publishing, distributing someone's work without their permission;0;R
LERA;However, using a portion of a work for scholarship or criticism is generally seen as fair use and does not require permission from the copyright holder.;0;R
LERA;But copyrights do expire. Current laws extend copyright protection for the life of the author plus 70 years.;0;R
Player;I've learned so much from you LERA. Thank you very much.:line,14
LERA;Don't thank me yet as you still need to complete your final task.;0;R
LERA;Going back to plagiarism, match the type of plagiarism to its description;0;R
Player;Start Game:scene,12
LERA;Perfect, here's the gavel.;0;R
Player;Thank you, LERA. I really learned so much today:line,19
LERA;You're welcome.;0;R
RIA;Thanks LERA;0;L
